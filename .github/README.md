  Wails template using SolidJS
</p>

## About

This template is just the minimal requirements for you to develop a wails application with solidjs.
<br/>
Hot-reloading is supported!

## Get Started

To use this template, run the following command in your desired directory:

`wails init -n my-solid-app -t https://github.com/LukenSkyne/wails-solid-template`

After navigating into the project directory with `cd my-solid-app` you can start the app in development mode:

`wails dev`

## Live Development

To run in live development mode, run `wails dev` in the project directory. In another terminal, go into the `frontend`
directory and run `npm run dev`. The frontend dev server will run on http://localhost:34115. Connect to this in your
browser and connect to your application.

## Building

To build a redistributable, production mode package, use `wails build`.
